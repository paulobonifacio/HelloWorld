# Overview

This project is my first step in building a personal software portfolio as a software engineer. The goal is to practice setting up a development environment, creating a simple program, and publishing it to GitHub to share publicly. 

The software is a very simple application that prints the message **"Hello World"** to the screen. This traditional exercise is a way to verify that everything is working correctly and to mark the beginning of my learning journey. 

The purpose of creating this software is to establish the workflow I will use throughout the course: writing code, documenting it, publishing it to GitHub, and recording a short video demonstration.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this project are:
* GitHub (for version control and hosting the repository)
* Visual Studio Code (as the code editor)
* Git (to push the project to GitHub)

The programming language I chose for this project is **Python**, since it is simple and already installed on my computer.

# Useful Websites

* [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) - Helpful for learning how to create repositories and push code.
* [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) - Reference for running and testing the program.
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - Quick help with writing the README file.
